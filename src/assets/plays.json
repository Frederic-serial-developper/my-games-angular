You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy.

One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.&#10;&#10;Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways.

A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.&#10;&#10;Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2760568_t.jpg","year":2011,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.56086,"categories":["Medieval","Farming"],"mechanisms":["Set Collection","Worker Placement"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":137290,"name":"Nosferatu","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2338335_t.jpg","playsCount":57,"plays":[{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-10-13","count":4},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-10-10","count":3},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-10-10","count":3},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-26","count":3},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-25","count":1},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-22","count":4},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-19","count":5},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-18","count":4},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-17","count":4},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-16","count":4},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2016-02-15","count":3},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2015-06-24","count":2},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2015-04-01","count":4},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2015-04-01","count":4},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2015-03-30","count":3},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2015-03-24","count":3},{"bggId":137290,"gameName":"Nosferatu","date":"2015-03-19","count":3}],"data":{"id":137290,"type":"GAME","description":"In 1887, a vampire wakes up and seeks to quench his thirst for blood. Brave men and women ally to destroy him &ndash; but to do so, they will have to thwart the plot of Renfield, his faithful servant.&#10;&#10;Nosferatu is a card game mixing tactics, bluffing, and team play, with the vampire and Renfield facing off against the vampire hunters. At the start of the game, everyone knows who Renfeld is, and Renfield knows which of the hunters is actually a vampire (as he chooses how to distribute the character cards), but the vampire's identity is hidden from everyone else. The hunters must identify the vampire and kill him with the ancestral stake before he can play five bite cards; if the hunters accidentally stake one of their own, then demoralized and weakened they lose the game.&#10;&#10;Each player other than Renfield starts with two cards from the library, which is comprised of rumors, incantations, bites and night cards. Five ritual cards &ndash; silver mirror, 2x blood transfusion, holy water and time distortion &ndash; are placed face-up on the table. Renfield creates a &quot;clock&quot; by taking one night card for each player and shuffling it with a dawn card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts a number of rounds, with the rounds continuing until one of the winning conditions is met. At the start of a round, players take turns doing the following: Drawing two cards from the library, discarding one card face-up, placing one card face-down in an action pile, then drawing a card from the clock. As soon as a player draws the dawn card or each player has played once, this part of the round ends.&#10;&#10;Renfield shuffles all the cards in the action pile, then reveals them. If the pile contains only incantations, the player holding the stake chooses one of the rituals, takes its action, then turns the ritual face-down. Once all five rituals have been used, the hunters win the game, but their main goal is to kill the vampire. If the deck contains bite cards, then Renfield applies the bites to the hunters, with a hunter losing one card in his stock for each bite; a hunter can have at most two bites. Night cards in the pile are added to the clock, thereby giving the vampire more time to work in future rounds, while making it tougher for players to achieve rituals.&#10;&#10;If the dawn card was revealed, the holder of the ancient stake can stab someone, thereby ending the game with victory for one side or the other, or pass the stake to another player. (If dawn didn't break, then the stake passes to another player with no opportunity for stabbing.)&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2338335_t.jpg","year":2013,"minPlayers":5,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":20,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.63713,"categories":["Horror","Bluffing","Card Game"],"mechanisms":["Partnerships","Hand Management"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":4174,"name":"Les Naufragés du Titanic","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic851307_t.jpg","playsCount":24,"plays":[{"bggId":4174,"gameName":"Lifeboat","date":"2017-08-29","count":1},{"bggId":4174,"gameName":"Lifeboat","date":"2016-04-01","count":1},{"bggId":4174,"gameName":"Lifeboat","date":"2016-03-31","count":1},{"bggId":4174,"gameName":"Lifeboat","date":"2016-03-30","count":1},{"bggId":4174,"gameName":"Lifeboat","date":"2016-01-10","count":20}],"data":{"id":4174,"type":"GAME","description":"from original publishers' Web site&#10;&#10;Adrift in uncharted waters, six people share a tiny lifeboat.

But it's also a board game with rules which allow for reflection and optimization.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the players are at their home base and receive their mission briefing. The object is then to complete it in as few attempts as possible. The actions and movements of the players will use Temporal Units (TU), the quantity of which depend on the scenario and the amount of players. Each attempt is called a &quot;run&quot;; one run equals the use of all of the Temporal Units at the players' disposal. When the TU reach zero, the agents are recalled to the agency, and restart the scenario from the beginning, armed with their experience. The object of the game is to make the perfect run, while solving all of the puzzles and overcoming all of a scenario&rsquo;s obstacles.&#10;&#10;The base box contains the entirety of the T.I.M.E Stories system and allows players to play all of the scenarios, the first of which &mdash; Asylum &mdash; is included. During a scenario, which consists of a deck of 120+ cards, each player explores cards, presented most often in the form of a panorama. Access to some cards require the possession of the proper item or items, while others present surprises, enemies, riddles, clues, and other dangers.&#10;&#10;You usually take possession of local hosts to navigate in a given environment, but who knows what you'll have to do to succeed? Roam a med-fan city, looking for the dungeon where the Syaan king is hiding? Survive in the Antarctic while enormous creatures lurk beneath the surface of the ice? Solve a puzzle in an early 20th century asylum? That is all possible, and you might even have to jump from one host to another, or play against your fellow agents from time to time...&#10;&#10;In the box, an insert allows players to &quot;save&quot; the game at any point, to play over multiple sessions, just like in a video game.

The opposing player then adds it to one end of the line, although he cannot score points by doing so.&#10;&#10;The first player to score seven points wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1083214_t.jpg","year":2011,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":15,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":5.96011,"categories":["Novel-based"],"mechanisms":["Pattern Building","Memory"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":true},{"id":99437,"name":"Rumble in the House","status":"PREVIOUSLY_OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3120549_t.png","playsCount":18,"plays":[{"bggId":99437,"gameName":"Rumble in the House","date":"2016-05-18","count":3},{"bggId":99437,"gameName":"Rumble in the House","date":"2016-05-17","count":1},{"bggId":99437,"gameName":"Rumble in the House","date":"2015-09-11","count":4},{"bggId":99437,"gameName":"Rumble in the House","date":"2015-09-09","count":2},{"bggId":99437,"gameName":"Rumble in the House","date":"2015-09-08","count":4},{"bggId":99437,"gameName":"Rumble in the House","date":"2015-06-07","count":1},{"bggId":99437,"gameName":"Rumble in the House","date":"2015-05-29","count":3}],"data":{"id":99437,"type":"GAME","description":"Living together in a small house is difficult, and sometimes trouble arises.

Players must join their Agents into Factions, assign Missions and take their opponents down, to gather intel and win the most points.&#10;&#10;Each Agent card features a &quot;command&quot; on one end of the card and &quot;points&quot; on the other end. The direction in which you place the card determines from which asset you benefit.

If you choose to do the latter, add the top card from the deck to the Share you declined (or a Doubloon, if there's already three cards), thus increasing its value for the next player. If no shares interest you, blindly take the top card of the deck.&#10;&#10;The card backs give you a hint about what&rsquo;s in the next Shares: Pirates to board other ships, legendary Relics to collect, Rum to be scored at the end of the game, and Items with permanent, immediate, or secret effects.&#10;&#10;Every 4 or 5 rounds (depending on the number of players), Boarding action will occur! Add the strength of your Captain and your Pirates, apply any bonuses or penalties, and face your two neighbors! For each victory, your Pirates will gain Doubloons or steal some Loot! After the fight, all Pirates are discarded.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 12 (or 15) rounds. Players then add the value of their Doubloons and their Loot cards to determine who&rsquo;s the winner.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3585484_t.jpg","year":2016,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":45,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.96638,"categories":["Card Game","Pirates"],"mechanisms":["Card Drafting","Press Your Luck","Set Collection"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":140933,"name":"Blueprints","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1877243_t.jpg","playsCount":3,"plays":[{"bggId":140933,"gameName":"Blueprints","date":"2016-03-03","count":1},{"bggId":140933,"gameName":"Blueprints","date":"2016-02-29","count":1},{"bggId":140933,"gameName":"Blueprints","date":"2015-04-13","count":1}],"data":{"id":140933,"type":"GAME","description":"In Blueprints, players are architects who must use different colored dice to build three different structures from blueprints, with the dice providing different advantages to you.

Five clans of goblins are represented on the game cards, with goblins in one of three ranks. To build an army, a player must first recruit level I goblins, then build on those goblins with level II and finally level III. Those higher level goblins can be played only if a lower level goblin is of the same clan, and since goblins of the same clan have similar abilities or powers that mesh well, players tend to specialize in who they recruit to their ranks.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can play a new goblin, use a goblin's power, draw cards, or pass. Many goblins have special powers that come into play when they're recruited, attacked, removed from play, placed with other goblins, and so on.&#10;&#10;Once all players have passed, the player with the most powerful army wins the battle. Players keep cards in hand from one battle to the next, so laying out all your forces at once can leave you with little to do but get hit in later battles. The first player to win three battles wins the game.&#10;&#10;While the game play in GOSU2 remains much the same as in GOSU, some changes make it a different game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The game no longer includes activation tokens, which were used to draw cards or activate a goblin's power.&#10;    All text has been removed from the cards to make them (and the game as a whole) fully multilingual.&#10;    Goblin abilities are now based on seven symbols, each with a basic and a MAX version.&#10;    The game includes a new &laquo;link&raquo; ability.&#10;    The goblin clans are structured differently.&#10;&#10;&#10;Additionally, all cards are &quot;cold foil&quot; printed to make them shiny.

So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.&#10;&#10;Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.&#10;&#10;You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move.

The ship powers, player abilities, and board designs combine to create a limitless set of possibilities for how to play and strategies for how to win.&#10;&#10;With elegant mechanics, an infinity of scenarios, and easy-to-learn rules that lead to deep gameplay, Quantum is a one-of-a-kind game of space combat, strategy and colonization that will satisfy both hard-core and casual players.&#10;&#10;Quantum won the 2012 Game Design Award at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games, as a prototype game with the title Armada d6.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1727619_t.jpg","year":2013,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":60,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.34531,"categories":["Fighting","Space Exploration","Dice","Science Fiction"],"mechanisms":["Area Control / Area Influence","Grid Movement","Variable Player Powers","Dice Rolling","Modular Board"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":181404,"name":"Taverna","status":"OTHER","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2612537_t.jpg","playsCount":1,"plays":[{"bggId":181404,"gameName":"Taverna","date":"2015-10-16","count":1}],"data":{"id":181404,"type":"GAME","description":"It is Saint-Averna's day, the holiest day in the kingdom of Averna.

Our Goddess in her infinite wisdom has sent a group of Overseers to protect our world. They have the power to bend human traits to their will, and they will always battle between each other to create the perfect symmetry between virtues and vices of humankind. You will now choose whether to find the best balance &mdash; or completely crush it for your own good.&#10;&#10;Overseers is a drafting and bluffing game with a twist. Each player represents an Overseer whose objective is to bend traits in their favor to create the most dominant combination of virtues and vices. The game has three main phases:&#10;&#10;1] Drafting: Each player receives six cards at random from the deck, selects one of them, then passes the rest to the player sitting on their left. The goal is to build up the combination that will grant them the most victory points. Some cards grant points on their own, while others require the same type of cards to earn more points.&#10;&#10;2] Judgement: All players place their five trait cards in front of them in two rows: two face down and three face up to show the cards they chose. Give the information available, the Overseers then discuss which player has the strongest possible combination. After deliberating, players vote for this person using their token. The chosen player must then admit or deny the verdict:&#10;&#10;&mdash; If they admit having the strongest combination, they must then discard two cards from their combination.&#10;&mdash; If they deny this, the showdown phase happens, with all players revealing their scores. If the chosen player has the strongest combination, they lose the two cards that grant the most points; if not, instead they take one additional card of their choice from the discard pile.&#10;&#10;3] Scoring: Each player shows all cards in front of them, then calculates their score.&#10;&#10;The game might have other phases depending on the type of overseers being played as each character has special abilities that can change the outcome of the game, such as being able to peek at another player's hidden cards, steal a card before the scoring phase, or transform one card into another.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players secret their victory point (VP) tokens to keep their score secret, and after three rounds whoever has the most VPs wins.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3037469_t.jpg","year":2015,"minPlayers":3,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":45,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.97346,"categories":["Bluffing","Card Game"],"mechanisms":["Card Drafting","Variable Player Powers","Voting","Set Collection"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":203430,"name":"Fuji Flush","status":"OTHER","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3086849_t.jpg","playsCount":1,"plays":[{"bggId":203430,"gameName":"Fuji Flush","date":"2017-07-30","count":1}],"data":{"id":203430,"type":"GAME","description":"Be the first player to get rid of all of your cards!&#10;&#10;Join forces with fellow players to beat cards played by other players...or independently play the highest card to outdo all your opponents together, flushing their cards down the drain!&#10;&#10;Fuji Flush is a fast, fun, easy-to-learn card game that will have you shouting as your cards are sent down the drain!&#10;&#10;Fuji Flush is a card game, which consists of cards numbered 2 through 20, with higher numbers being rarer.

Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&#10;&#10;The players embody master builders.

When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.

Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses.

What sets the game apart from other games of this design is that almost everything in the race zone can move position, so the players need to plan with that in mind.&#10;&#10;So each round begins with the rolling of three dice; red, white and blue. These relate to coloured asteroids of the matching colour and each rock has a set of numbers from 1-6 printed on them. This gives every pilot the information they need to know where each object will most likely move to (the value rolled for each dice determines which direction the object moves in) using the hex based board.&#10;&#10;The trick is that some objects move a differing number of spaces and objects react differently when collisions occur, thus a player's best laid plans may not pan out due to mistakes.&#10;&#10;Mistakes introduces the other unique aspect of Asteroyds.

Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2869710_t.jpg","year":2014,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":40,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.22551,"categories":["Trains","Fighting","American West"],"mechanisms":["Action / Movement Programming","Variable Player Powers","Take That","Memory","Hand Management","Modular Board"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":70323,"name":"King of Tokyo","status":"PREVIOUSLY_OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3043734_t.jpg","playsCount":25,"plays":[{"bggId":70323,"gameName":"King of Tokyo","date":"2016-04-21","count":3},{"bggId":70323,"gameName":"King of Tokyo","date":"2016-04-18","count":2},{"bggId":70323,"gameName":"King of Tokyo","date":"2016-01-10","count":20}],"data":{"id":70323,"type":"GAME","description":"In King of Tokyo, you play mutant monsters, gigantic robots, and strange aliens&mdash;all of whom are destroying Tokyo and whacking each other in order to become the one and only King of Tokyo.&#10;&#10;At the start of each turn, you roll six dice, which show the following six symbols: 1, 2, or 3 Victory Points, Energy, Heal, and Attack.

After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board.&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand.

Players start with 21 points of health (or 18 in a tag-team match) and roll custom dice to try to either reduce the opponent's strength points to zero to win by a knock-out (KO) or hold the opponent down on the mat for a &quot;count of three&quot; to win by a pin.&#10;&#10;The player sitting near the 'red' corner of the wrestling ring uses 4 'red' wrestling dice, the player near the 'blue' corner, the 4 blue wrestling dice.&#10;Each player also has a HIT die and a PIN die.&#10;&#10;Players begin by each rolling their own set of 'wrestling dice' at the same time, trying to ensure that they land in, or touching the wrestling ring. &#10;The results of HITs, BLOCKs, COUNTERs, and MISS rolled are played off against each other then the HIT dice can be rolled to see what damage they did. i.e Drop Kick, Forearm smash, Table slam etc.  Damage is recorded on the Strength Score Card of the player being hit.&#10;If a player rolls two HITs in one round, instead of rolling the HIT dice twice, they can take a chance on the Luchador! die once which may result in their wrestler's trademark moves and inflict much more damage on their opponent.&#10;&#10;Any PINs rolled in a round may be re-rolled, once only. However once an opponent is reduced on their strength to where they are pinable, the PIN die is held until after the HITs have been inflicted then the PIN die is rolled. If PIN comes up, the 'three count' begins. The player being pinned has three attempts to save, using their wrestling dice or lose the match.&#10;&#10;In a tag-team match players have the choice of trying to tag-out to regain slight strength, but it can also cost them..., if they fail to tag and get dragged back into the ring by their eager opponent.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1718403_t.jpg","year":2013,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":15,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.55387,"categories":["Dice","Action / Dexterity","Sports"],"mechanisms":["Press Your Luck","Partnerships","Dice Rolling"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":true},{"id":171233,"name":"The Big Book of Madness","status":"OTHER","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2750172_t.jpg","playsCount":1,"plays":[{"bggId":171233,"gameName":"The Big Book of Madness","date":"2017-08-04","count":1}],"data":{"id":171233,"type":"GAME","description":"So far your first year at the Elementary College has been slightly disappointing.

When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.&#10;&#10;From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished.

You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnar&ouml;k, the ultimate inescapable doom.&#10;&#10;Most player strategies are guided by the cards drafted at the beginning of each of the three game rounds (or Ages).

They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed.

That said, the game differs in a number of ways from Mr. Jack. In more detail...&#10;&#10;In Le Fant&ocirc;me de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, eight suspect tokens stand in the ten rooms of the Op&eacute;ra Garnier. Each suspect has a reason to drive the opera singer La Carlotta away from the production, and at the start of the game one of the suspects is randomly determined to be the true identity of the Phantom player. The other player is the Investigator, and he wants to discover the Phantom's identity; if he does so before La Carlotta flees the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, then he wins. Otherwise, he loses. (To balance play between newcomers and experienced players La Carlotta's starting position can changed.)&#10;&#10;At the start of each odd round, eight suspect cards are shuffled and four of them revealed. The Investigator moves one suspect and (likely) uses this suspect's unique ability, then the Phantom moves two of the remaining three suspects, then the Investigator moves the final suspect. The Phantom player then reveals whether he can or cannot cause a disturbance in the Op&eacute;ra Garnier, thus scaring La Carlotta; he can cause a disturbance only if he's alone or if he's in the room with the blackout token. If he can cause a disturbance, the Investigator clears all suspects sharing a lit room; if not, the Investigator clears all suspects in the dark or on their own. After this, La Carlotta moves one step closer to fleeing for each suspect that hasn't been declared innocent (and an additional step if the Phantom did create a disturbance).&#10;&#10;For each even round, the remaining four suspect cards are revealed, and the players again move characters and use their special abilities, with the Phantom going first. The game continues until only a single suspect is not innocent or La Carlotta flees France for the safety of Milan.&#10;&#10;When a character moves, it can move up to as many spaces as the number of characters in the room from which it moves. Most characters can move only through open corridors, but Meg Giry can use secret passageways that connect many of the rooms. The players must use Meg's ability and the other characters' special abilities to hide or reveal information. One character, for example, moves a padlock that blocks one corridor, while another is responsible for the roaming blackout that allows the Phantom to operate in darkness (or at least provide cover for his activity elsewhere). One sweet character can draw everyone from adjacent rooms to her side, while an unpleasant fellow can drive everyone away. Still another reveals (or hides) an alibi card, clearing one suspect (or keeping his true nature unknown). Every character is useful in the right situation. You just have to learn what those situations are...&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1726671_t.jpg","year":2013,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":2,"playingTime":30,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.10245,"categories":["Novel-based","Deduction"],"mechanisms":["Grid Movement","Variable Player Powers"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":108784,"name":"Ascension: Storm of Souls","status":"OTHER","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1149059_t.jpg","playsCount":2,"plays":[{"bggId":108784,"gameName":"Ascension: Storm of Souls","date":"2015-11-28","count":1},{"bggId":108784,"gameName":"Ascension: Storm of Souls","date":"2013-11-22","count":1}],"data":{"id":108784,"type":"GAME","description":"Samael is dead, but a storm is still raging across Vigil.

It's simply killing!&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player will assume the role of &quot;The Don&quot;, and will call out the steps in gameplay.&#10;&#10;Before the skirmish itself, an available pot of cash will be laid out before the players. This pot must be evenly split up amongst all of the surviving hoods.&#10;&#10;After that, the &quot;Don&quot; of the round will ask the players, including himself, to load their guns (in the form of selecting one of three possible cards: &quot;Bang!&quot;, &quot;Bang! Bang! Bang!&quot; or &quot;Click! Click!&quot; from a set of 8 cards: 2 &quot;Bang!&quot;s, 1 Triple-&quot;Bang!&quot; and 5 &quot;Clicks!&quot;), and then count down to all of the players aiming their guns (real foam guns).&#10;&#10;Each player will then take a look at how many guns are pointed at them, and also take a look at the available pot of cash for the round before deciding if they want to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; and remove themselves from the skirmish. If they choose to back down, they will get a &quot;Chicken&quot; token which will deduct from their ill-gotten gains at the end of the game.&#10;But all players have to &quot;Chicken Out&quot; at the same time, using a countdown like the aiming.&#10;&#10;The remaining players will resolve the shootout showing their cards. First, all Triple-&quot;Bangs!&quot; wound the players they are aimed at. If there are still-aiming players with &quot;Bang!&quot; cards, those now wound their targets. &quot;Click!&quot;s are only bluffs and do nothing. A player that is wounded during the standoff does not participate in the split of the cash and receives a bandage (any player that receives a certain number of bandages is eliminated from the game). Now all the used cards are discarded--even those of the players that &quot;Chickened Out&quot;.&#10;&#10;Now the remaining players will finally split the cash. If the cash cannot be divided evenly, the rest is kept on the table and is added to the new pot.&#10;&#10;The game is played 8 rounds, until all cards were played. Keeping track of the cards is important, since all players have only a limited supply of &quot;real&quot; shots.&#10;&#10;There are a couple of expansions packed-in with most editions that change some of the mechanics of the game, and also add a new &quot;traitor&quot;-based mechanic, as well.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic87523_t.jpg","year":2005,"minPlayers":4,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":30,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.65254,"categories":["Mafia","Fighting","Negotiation","Bluffing","Party Game","Card Game","Humor"],"mechanisms":["Variable Player Powers","Simultaneous Action Selection","Player Elimination"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":124708,"name":"Mice and Mystics","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1312072_t.jpg","playsCount":1,"plays":[{"bggId":124708,"gameName":"Mice and Mystics","date":"2015-06-28","count":1}],"data":{"id":124708,"type":"GAME","description":"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;In Mice and Mystics players take on the roles of those still loyal to the king &ndash; but to escape the clutches of Vanestra, they have been turned into mice!

But drilling often request the help of other players (forced or not). Each one therefore moves four drills on the arcs stratum of the planet to successfully implement his mines and extract maximum resources. The Fame points are acquired by spending materials, filling objectives and having majorities of material and money at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game...&#10;&#10;Acquire the most Renown points at the end of the game.

The order in which the players&rsquo; vice presidents are deployed is determined by a closed-fist auction.&#10;&#10;Phase 1...&#10;&#10;This is the main phase. Players will move their drill crews are at a rate of one per round (there are four rounds before Phase 2). Depending on the position of your vice president, if you deployed him to act in this phase, you can corrupt opposing drill crews (in order to attract them to the same tile as your active drill crew) or hire a subcontractor (to increase your drilling power).&#10;&#10;Each tile of the earth's crust has a value indicating its resistance to drilling. If the sum of the drill crews who are present equals or exceeds this value, the tile is excavated and turned over; then draw an Extraction card to see what resources you discovered, which is evenly split between the players who participated in the drilling. The indivisible remainder goes to one of those players (prioritized by whoever has a mine on the tile, then the player who has the greater drilling power, then the one who triggered the drilling).&#10;&#10;Finally, after the four rounds, the mines laid on drilled tiles provide the resources printed on the back of the tile.&#10;&#10;Phase 2...&#10;&#10;Players with a vice president here can perform market transactions, which is to say that they can buy or sell resources.&#10;&#10;Phase 3...&#10;&#10;In this phase, players can make investments to get renown points and improve their drilling conditions in different ways&hellip;&#10;&#10;&#10;     augment the drill crews&rsquo; power (maximum = 4),&#10;     place mines in the game (maximum three mines),&#10;     improve mine safety (in order to avoid wasting resources at extraction time),&#10;     improve the movement of drill crews.&#10;&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1661396_t.jpg","year":2013,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":90,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.30338,"categories":["Economic","Number","Exploration","Industry / Manufacturing"],"mechanisms":["Area Control / Area Influence","Area Movement","Worker Placement","Modular Board"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":146731,"name":"Sherlock Holmes Détective Conseil: Les Masques Africains","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752703_t.jpg","playsCount":1,"plays":[{"bggId":146731,"gameName":"Sherlock Holmes Détective Conseil: Les Masques Africains","date":"2016-08-17","count":1}],"data":{"id":146731,"type":"EXPANSION","description":"This expansion to the 2011 Ystari re-edition of Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective contains 1 Case book and 1 newspaper.&#10;&#10;The date is 5 February 1902 and you have to unleash the mystery of the murder of Sgt MacSwinney, a second boer war veteran.&#10;&#10;This case as a strong historical context and some Times articles are actually out of the real Times archive of this day.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1752703_t.jpg","year":2013,"minPlayers":1,"maxPlayers":8,"playingTime":150,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.865,"categories":["Novel-based","Deduction","Murder/Mystery"],"mechanisms":["Co-operative Play"],"expansion":true},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":143147,"name":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic904315_t.jpg","playsCount":17,"plays":[{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-05-29","count":3},{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-05-27","count":3},{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-02-27","count":4},{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-02-26","count":3},{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-02-23","count":1},{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-02-23","count":1},{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-02-23","count":1},{"bggId":143147,"gameName":"Saboteur (compilation editions)","date":"2015-02-23","count":1}],"data":null,"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":205610,"name":"A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King","status":"OTHER","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic3122395_t.jpg","playsCount":1,"plays":[{"bggId":205610,"gameName":"A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King","date":"2017-08-12","count":1}],"data":{"id":205610,"type":"GAME","description":"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The king has called for a lavish feast and tourney, the likes of which have not been seen in the Seven Kingdoms since the days of Aegon the Conquerer.

As a lord of Scotland with land, men and money at your disposal, now is the time to lay your claim. But you are not alone. Your rivals have been waiting for just such an opportunity themselves and they are poised to act. With the clans of Scotland ready to follow the strongest leader, it is up to you to win the loyalty of the clans first. If you can demonstrate your prowess in battle to enough clans, then the rest will fall in line behind you. Do you have the audacity and cunning it takes to be crowned king?&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;How to Play&#10;&#10;You acquire the support you need to win the game by winning skirmishes against your rivals. A skirmish is five consecutive rounds of play. During each round of a skirmish, you have the opportunity to either build up your army by playing cards from your hand or recruit clans to fight for you by drawing cards from the recruit pile. At the end of the five rounds, each lord gets to claim a supporter in order of highest strength army to lowest. Then you discard all the clans you mustered and begin a new skirmish.  The game ends when one lord reaches forty or more points worth of supporters and claims the throne. If you hope to be the one to do so, you will need to know when to commit your forces to battle and when to regroup to fight another day.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Design Notes&#10;&#10;Lords of Scotland borrows design elements of Three-Dragon Ante, Condottiere and Havoc: The Hundred Years War and sets the action in the interregnum period of Scottish history surrounding the wars for Scottish Independence.  The gameplay is broken up into five-round skirmishes which are conducted in a turn based clockwise fashion.  During each skirmish, the ability to activate more special card powers by going first is balanced by the knowledge of what strength card you need to play to win by going last.  Throughout the game there is a general pressure to use resources to make immediate attacks of opportunity, balanced against the need to collect resources for long-term strategic advantage.  Lords of Scotland scales well to the number of players with most victories being determined in the final skirmish.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2338327_t.jpg","year":2010,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":35,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.8049,"categories":["Fighting","Medieval","Card Game"],"mechanisms":["Hand Management"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":145203,"name":"Prosperity","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1717367_t.jpg","playsCount":2,"plays":[{"bggId":145203,"gameName":"Prosperity","date":"2016-11-08","count":1},{"bggId":145203,"gameName":"Prosperity","date":"2016-11-07","count":1}],"data":{"id":145203,"type":"GAME","description":"You're the leader of a great nation which is currently expanding.

You owe it to future generations to leave them a healthy world. Pollution lurks, but will you be able to limit it?&#10;&#10;Prosperity has players building up their countries on a grand but abstract scale, with them needing to balance concerns over energy and ecology with the constant need for capital and the long-term goal of prosperity points.&#10;&#10;The game starts with 24 tiles available, half on the energy side of the shared game board and half on the ecology side. Two tiles on each side are placed on levels 1-6, with the players each having two research markers &ndash; energy and ecology &ndash; that start at level 1. Each player has an individual game board with color-coded spaces for tiles, a pollution track, and tracks for energy and ecology. A stack of 36 tiles &ndash; with tiles arranged by decades: the six from 2030 on the bottom, then the five from 2020, and so on to the five from 1970 &ndash; is set up during the playing area.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws the top tile from the stack, then everyone resolves the symbol highlighted on the tile:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Energy &ndash; for a positive value, earn money; for a negative value, lose money or increase your pollution&#10;    Ecology &ndash; remove or add discs to your pollution track&#10;    Capital &ndash; earn money for each capital symbol on the tiles you own&#10;    Research &ndash; advance one research marker one space for each research symbol on tiles you own&#10;    Prosperity &ndash; score points for each prosperity symbol on tiles you own, but only if your pollution isn't maxed out&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has done this, the active player takes two actions, repeating an action if desired. The possible actions are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take money.&#10;    Remove one pollution marker.&#10;    Move forward one space on one research track.&#10;    Buy a tile, with the amount owed being based on whether the tile is energy or ecology and the level of your corresponding research marker. If you buy a tile of the same level, the cost is &euro;100; if the tile is of a higher level, you pay &euro;100, plus &euro;100 for each level; and if the tile is lower, you pay a flat &euro;50.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players have limited space for tiles on their individual boards, especially since the tiles and spaces are color-coded, but players can cover existing tiles, if desired, losing any benefits (or penalties) in the process. Some parts of the individual board are off-limits to new infrastructure until you first provide transport; toll roads, highways and even train systems have drawbacks of their own, but ideally you'll be able to build your way past those trouble spots without causing too much pollution.&#10;&#10;When the final tile is drawn, that player finishes his turn, then everyone scores: twice for their energy and ecology levels, one for capital (with money being converted into prosperity points), once for research on both tracks (with points for those researching the most), and once for prosperity.

If her sum exceeds 7, she removes her piece from the board and starts the lap from the beginning next turn.&#10;&#10;If one piece lands on another, the bottom piece must carry the top one when it next moves; what's more, the owner of the piece on top dictates how many dice the bottom player must roll &mdash; and if those dice sum to more than seven, then both pieces are removed from the track.

Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1772936_t.jpg","year":2013,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":120,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.81793,"categories":["Trains","Industry / Manufacturing"],"mechanisms":["Worker Placement"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":68448,"name":"7 Wonders","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic860217_t.jpg","playsCount":9,"plays":[{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2017-06-16","count":1},{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2017-06-15","count":1},{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2017-06-13","count":1},{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2017-06-12","count":1},{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2017-06-07","count":1},{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2017-06-06","count":1},{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2017-06-04","count":2},{"bggId":68448,"gameName":"7 Wonders","date":"2015-11-22","count":1}],"data":{"id":68448,"type":"GAME","description":"You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World.

If you advance boldly, you draw a card from the location deck, which holds three types of cards: one that allows that player to either redraw or stop, one that grants new treasure from the treasure hall, and (of course) the dragon. If you draw the dragon, you lose one health point (out of two), the dragon calms down (i.e., it loses one temper point), and the location deck is reshuffled. If you're injured twice, you die and are out of the game.&#10;&#10;When fleeing cautiously, you first discard a treasure worth at least one coin, then roll a d10. If your roll is higher than the number of cards in the location deck, the dragon calms down, then you reshuffle the location deck; otherwise you must draw a card from the location deck just as when someone advances boldly.

And when attacked, it could &quot;blast&quot; your man off the board and out of play.&#10;&#10;The first to capture an enemy flag is the winner!&#10;&#10;This game is similar to, and almost certainly derived directly from, the H.P. Gibsons (UK) game L'Attaque (1909). It is not exactly the same, but not far from it (numbered pieces, spy (same name) can kill the strongest piece but only when attacking, flag, bombs, etc.) This game in turn almost certainly drew on the classic Chinese children's game Jungle.&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;     Stratego (Revised Edition) (aka Stratego Fire &amp; Ice)&#10;     The Generals&#10;     Stratego Legends&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars&#10;     Stratego: The Lord of the Rings&#10;     Ultimate Stratego&#10;     Electronic Stratego&#10;     Stratego: Marvel Heroes&#10;     Stratego: Star Wars Saga Edition&#10;     Stratego: The Chronicles of Narnia&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;and numerous others.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;    Admirals&#10;    Lu Zhan Jun Qi&#10;    L'Attaque&#10;    Batalj&#10;    Sharpe's Attack&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Different Edition Complications&#10;When first produced in Europe, the most powerful pieces had higher numbers.  I.e. the Marshall (most powerful piece) was a 10, the General was a 9, and so on.  The higher the rank, the higher the number.&#10;When they introduced Stratego in the USA, the numbering was reversed, so the Marshall was a 1, the General 2, and so on.  The 1st rank (most powerful) was 1, the second most powerful was 2, 3rd most powerful was 3....&#10;Then, in 2000s Hasbro re-imagined Stratego in the USA and made a few changes.  They reduced the number of pieces per side (from 40 to 30), added additional powers, and changed the numbering to reflect the European system.&#10;This caused extreme consternation with many faithful American Stratego fans who preferred the 'old way'.  (Actually the second oldest way, but whatever.)  Many of these insist on playing Stratego with the 'Marshall 1 system'.&#10;This wouldn't be a problem, except any and all discussions of Stratego are fraught with misunderstandings by those who are unaware of dual numbering systems!

Through exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&#10;&#10;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. The game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&#10;&#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw.

Each player starts with an identical set of 12 dice in their dice bag. At the start of the game, Creature and Spell dice (Quarry) are dealt at random to form &quot;the Wilds&quot; in the center of the table. As play progresses, players roll their dice to attempt to summon Creatures, cast Spells, and harness the magical power of Quiddity (the in-game resource) to capture Quarry from the Wilds to add to their repertoire and into their dice bag. Players draw and roll 6 dice a turn from their bag, making that controlling bag composition is key to victory.&#10;&#10;Quarriors is a fast-paced game where players must strategically balance their choices each turn. Do I use my Quiddity to summon Creatures in the hopes of scoring Glory or should I spend it all to capture more powerful Quarry from the Wilds? Players must outmaneuver their opponent's through strategic Spell use, the acquisition of powerful Quarry, and ultimately, by striking down opponent's Creature in combat.

But some say that one's reward in the afterlife is based on the misery endured in life. If so, there may yet be hope&mdash;if not in this world, then in the peace that lies beyond.&#10;&#10;In the Gloom card game, you assume control of the fate of an eccentric family of misfits and misanthropes. The goal of the game is sad, but simple: you want your characters to suffer the greatest tragedies possible before passing on to the well-deserved respite of death. You'll play horrible mishaps like Pursued by Poodles or Mocked by Midgets on your own characters to lower their Self-Worth scores, while trying to cheer your opponents' characters with marriages and other happy occasions that pile on positive points. The player with the lowest total Family Value wins.&#10;&#10;Printed on transparent plastic cards, Gloom features an innovative design by noted RPG author Keith Baker. Multiple modifier cards can be played on top of the same character card; since the cards are transparent, elements from previously played modifier cards either show through or are obscured by those played above them. You'll immediately and easily know the worth of every character, no matter how many modifiers they have.

Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&#10;&#10;2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&#10;&#10;3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&#10;&#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&#10;&#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&#10;&#10;4.

To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins.

You have one TIKI (statue) to bring your opponents into trouble. You can put this one on any space you want. If your opponent wants to build there a hut: Bad Luck. There are also two cards which you use to change the color of a hut (to make it yours).&#10; The game ends if one player managed it to place all his huts on the island or if one beach is complete with huts and/or tikis at the end of a turn.&#10;&#10;In the advanced rules, it is possible to legally &quot;cheat&quot;.

The king has only so much time before he is overpowered by his own subjects but using guile and swords of his guards he may be able to eliminate the assassins and hopefully escape into the safety of his palace.&#10;&#10;The gameplay is based upon Action Cards which show a limited number of Action Points available to both sides. First, the king and his knights move around the board securing their position or eliminating dangers by pushing aside the crowd, then the assassins hidden among the crowd prepare for their lethal strike by killing guards or making the king's progress slower. It's up to the players to make the most of the Action Points available in the current round. The king's player wins if he manages to escape from the board using one of the exits or if his knights eliminate all the assassins.

Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).&#10;     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out. The actions on the next Action tile are then carried out and so on, until all major or all minor actions have been performed. Then, the players come back to the stopped action to perform it. Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council. Any druid can start from the council to enter back the path, but he can also stay at the council to influence it and gain MP at the end of the round.&#10;     Activation of magical stones. At the end of each round, all stones that are aligned and of the same colour automatically become menhirs.

If it is not possible to shut in the central door by connecting menhirs, then MP are attributed to the players for the creatures that they have captured.&#10;&#10;THE WINNER&#10;&#10;The winner is the player with the highest MP score.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic1302927_t.png","year":2012,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":5,"playingTime":120,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.71711,"categories":["Fantasy"],"mechanisms":["Area Enclosure","Action / Movement Programming","Worker Placement"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":478,"name":"Citadelles","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic902227_t.jpg","playsCount":5,"plays":[{"bggId":478,"gameName":"Citadels","date":"2017-08-11","count":1},{"bggId":478,"gameName":"Citadels","date":"2017-08-09","count":1},{"bggId":478,"gameName":"Citadels","date":"2016-03-20","count":1},{"bggId":478,"gameName":"Citadels","date":"2015-03-31","count":1},{"bggId":478,"gameName":"Citadels","date":"2015-03-23","count":1}],"data":null,"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":25568,"name":"Metropolys","status":"OTHER","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic297075_t.jpg","playsCount":10,"plays":[{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2017-07-07","count":1},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2017-03-13","count":1},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2016-12-23","count":2},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2016-12-22","count":1},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2016-12-21","count":1},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2016-12-15","count":1},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2016-11-02","count":1},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2016-10-27","count":1},{"bggId":25568,"gameName":"Metropolys","date":"2015-09-25","count":1}],"data":{"id":25568,"type":"GAME","description":"Talented Urban planners and architects rival each other to construct luxury, elegant buildings of glass and steel, defying the laws of balance.

With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&#10;&#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&#10;&#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!&#10;&#10;Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&#10;&#10;The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2004236_t.jpg","year":2014,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":6,"playingTime":90,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":7.3134,"categories":["Civilization","Fighting","Exploration"],"mechanisms":["Area Control / Area Influence","Grid Movement","Variable Player Powers","Deck / Pool Building","Modular Board"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":3570,"name":"Pique-Plume","status":"OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic367311_t.jpg","playsCount":2,"plays":[{"bggId":3570,"gameName":"Chicken Cha Cha Cha","date":"2015-09-06","count":1},{"bggId":3570,"gameName":"Chicken Cha Cha Cha","date":"2015-09-06","count":1}],"data":{"id":3570,"type":"GAME","description":"Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (&quot;cha cha&quot;) by completing circuits around the yard.&#10;&#10;Goal: To &quot;cha cha&quot; your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's &quot;tail feathers&quot; as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch&#10;&#10;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.&#10;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.&#10;&#10;","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic406697_t.jpg","year":1997,"minPlayers":2,"maxPlayers":4,"playingTime":20,"name":null,"source":"BOARDGAMEGEEK","rating":6.61313,"categories":["Children's Game","Animals","Memory"],"mechanisms":["Memory"],"expansion":false},"previouslyOwned":false},{"id":168433,"name":"The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service","status":"PREVIOUSLY_OWNED","image":"https://cf.geekdo-images.com/images/pic2359273_t.jpg","playsCount":1,"plays":[{"bggId":168433,"gameName":"The World of Smog: On Her Majesty's Service","date":"2017-03-26","count":1}],"data":{"id":168433,"type":"GAME","description":"Set in the fantastic steampunk The World of Smog created by Panache Animation, On Her Majesty's Service is a stylish board game for two to four competing players.

Earth is recovering from a catastrophic explosion that exterminated the majority of the population centuries ago and made most of the surface uninhabitable due to unearthly weather conditions. The surviving humans organized along four radically different ideologies, called Paths, to rebuild the world as they see fit: Harmony, Dominance, Progress, and Salvation. Followers of the four Paths live in a fragile peace, but in almost complete isolation next to each other. Their only meeting point is the last major city on Earth, now just known as the Capital.&#10;&#10;By powering up the mysterious Time Rifts that opened in the wake of the cataclysm, each Path is able to reach back to specific moments in their past. Doing so can greatly speed up their progress, but too much meddling may endanger the time-space continuum. But progress is more important than ever before: if the mysterious message arriving through the Time Rift is to be believed, an even more terrible cataclysm is looming on the horizon: an asteroid bearing the mysterious substance called Neutronium is heading towards Earth. Even stranger, the scientists show that the energy signature of the asteroid matches the explosion centuries ago...&#10;&#10;Anachrony features a unique two-tiered worker placement system. To travel to the Capital or venture out to the devastated areas for resources, players need not only various Specialists (Engineers, Scientists, Administrators, and Geniuses) but also Exosuits to protect and enhance them &mdash; and both are in short supply.&#10;&#10;The game is played in 4-7 turns, depending on the time when the looming cataclysm occurs (unless, of course, it is averted!). The elapsed turns are measured on a dynamic Timeline. By powering up the Time Rifts, players can reach back to earlier turns to supply their past &quot;self&quot; with resources. Each Path has a vastly different objective that rewards it with a massive amount of Victory Points when achieved. The Paths' settlements will survive the impact, but the Capital will not.
